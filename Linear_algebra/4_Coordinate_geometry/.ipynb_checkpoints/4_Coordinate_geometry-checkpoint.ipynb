    "In his works the *Elements*, Euclid described a *point* as *\"that which has no part\"*\n",
    "A point has position only, it has no length, width or thickness, and thus no area or volume. As we've already seen, a typical point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is described by its co-ordinates $(a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n)$, where the $a_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We also think of $\\mathbb{R}^0$ as a single point. This might seem a bit strange because what does a $0$-tuple even mean? However, it makes sense for us to adopt this absolutely standard convention.\n",
