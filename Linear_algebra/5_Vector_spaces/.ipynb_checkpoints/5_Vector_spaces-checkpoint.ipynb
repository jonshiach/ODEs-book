    "The name *'vector space'* indicates a connection with the study of vectors. Indeed our Euclidean spaces $\\mathbb{R}^n$, as introduced in [Vectors](vectors-chapter), are vector spaces over $F=\\mathbb{R}^n$. Addition and scalar multiplication, in the sense of a vector space, for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are as given in [vector addition](vector-addition-definition) and [scalar multiplication](scalar-multiplication-of-a-vector-definition) respectively. Euclidean vector spaces are often the first examples of vector spaces that a student meets. However, maybe they do not quite demonstrate the power behind this construction. The real motivation of the study of the vector spaces comes from the fact that a lot of more abstract sets, such as differentiable functions or matrices, can be viewed as vector spaces. Everything that we learn about vector spaces can be then applied to any set which satisfies the definition of a vector space. This means that the set of $m\\times n$ matrices with matrix addition and scalar multiplication or the set of all polynomials of degree at most $n$, in some sense, behave in a very similar fashion to Euclidean space.\n",

    "Of course not all sets are vector spaces. For example, consider the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ over $\\mathbb{R}$. It is easy to show that the axioms A1 to A4 are satisfied for the set of integers. The problem comes when one tries to define scalar multiplication. From the [definition of scalar multiplication](vector-space-definition), $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ so for $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\alpha x$ must be in $\\mathbb{Z}$. However, this is not always the case, for example, when $u=1$ and $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$. This was an example of a proof by counterexample where we just need to show 1 instance where the axioms are not satisfied to prove that we do not have a vector space.\n",
