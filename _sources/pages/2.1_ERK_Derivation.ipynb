After importing SymPy we need to declare each of the coefficients $a_{21}$, $b_1$, $b_2$ and $c_2$ as symbolic variables using the `sp.symbols()` command before setting $c_2=1$. Each order condition is then defined using these symbolic variables. Note that SymPy assumes that equations are equal to zero which is why we have subtracted the right-hand side. We have also used the `sp.Rational(1,2)` command for the fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$ so that SymPy will output any fractional values as fractions rather than decimals. The system of three equations `eq1`, `eq2` and `eq3` is then solved using the `sp.solve` command.\n",
