# ODEs Exercises

Answer the following exercises based on the content from this chapter. The solutions can be found in the [appendices](odes-solutions-section).

```{exercise}
:label: ch1-ex1

Solve the following IVP using the Euler method with a step length of $h = 0.5$. Write down your solutions correct to 4 decimal places.
\begin{align*}
    y' + y = 1 - e^{-t}  \qquad t\in [0,4], \qquad y(0) = 1.
\end{align*}

```

```{exercise}
:label: ch1-ex2

The exact solution to the IVP from {ref}`ch1-ex1` is $y = 1 - te^{-t}$. Write a Python or MATLAB program to compute the solution to this IVP and calculate the absolute error for each value. Present your results in the form of a table and a plot of the numerical and exact solutions.
```

```{exercise}
:label: ch1-ex3

Repeat {ref}`ch1-ex2` using values of $h = 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05$ to solve the IVP.

(a) Produce a plot of the numerical solutions on the same axes.

(b) Calculate the global truncation error for $y(1)$ and present your results as a table and a plot of the global truncation error against the step length $h$. (Hint: you can use the NumPy command `idx = np.argmin(abs(t - t0))` or the MATLAB command `[~,idx] = min(abs(t - t0))` to determine the index of the value in the array `t` which is closest to `t0`).

(c) Comment on your results. What do they tell you about the Euler method?

````{exercise}
:label: ch1-ex4

The motion of a pendulum can be modelled by the following ODE

$$ \begin{align*}
    \ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) = 0,
\end{align*} $$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the pendulum and the vertical, $L$ is the length of the pendulum and $g=9.81\text{ms}^{-2}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Write a program that solves this IVP using the Euler method with $h=0.001$ over the interval $t\in [0, 5]$ for a pendulum of length $L = 1$ set at an initial angle $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Produce a plot of the displacement angle $\theta$ against $t$.
