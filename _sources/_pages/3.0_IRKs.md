# Implicit Runge-Kutta Methods

Runge-Kutta methods can be either an explicit or implicit methods depending on the functions used to calculate the stage values. We have seen in the [previous chapter on explicit methods](erk-chapter) that they are straightforward to apply, however they are not always suitable for solving ODEs that are [stiff](stiffness-section). This is why we need to also consider implicit methods.

Recall that the general form of a Runge-Kutta method to solve a first-order ODE $y'=f(t,y)$ is

$$ \begin{align*}
   y_{n+1} &=y_n + h \sum_{i=1}^s b_i k_i,\\
   k_i &=f(t_n +c_i h,y_n + h \sum_{j=1}^s a_{ij} k_j).
\end{align*} $$

Expanding out the stage value functions we have

$$\begin{align*}
    k_1 &= f(t_n + c_1 h, y_n + h (a_{11} k_1 + a_{12} k_2 + \cdots + a_{1s} k_s), \\
    k_2 &= f(t_n + c_2 h, y_n + h (a_{21} k_1 + a_{22} k_2 + \cdots + a_{2s} k_s), \\
    & \vdots \\
    k_s &= f(t_n + c_1 h, y_n + h (a_{s1} k_1 + a_{s2} k_2 + \cdots + a_{ss} k_s).
\end{align*}$$

The value of $k_1$ appears withing the function on the right-hand side of $k_1$ and similar for the other stage values. This means these functions are **implicit** functions hence we have an implicit Runge-Kutta method. The Butcher tableau for an implicit method is

$$ \begin{array}{c|cccc}
    c_1  & a_{11}  & a_{12}  & \cdots  & a_{1s} \\
    c_2  & a_{21}  & a_{22}  & \cdots  & a_{2s} \\
    \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots \\
    c_s  & a_{s1}  & a_{s2}  & \cdots  & a_{ss} \\ \hline
    & b_1  & b_2  & \cdots  & b_s 
\end{array} $$

Note that the $A$ matrix in the upper right-hand region of an implicit method can have non-zero elements in them main diagonal and upper triangular region whereas the $A$ matrix for an explicit method has non-zero elements in the lower triangular region only.
