# Deriving order conditions using trees

In the [previous section](rk2-derivation-section) we saw that to derive an Explicit Runge-Kutta (ERK) method we equate Taylor expansions of the ODE $y'=f(t,y)$ and the general form of a Runge-Kutta method to derive a set of order conditions which need to be satisfied. This means we need to evaluate the derivatives of the bivariate function $f(t,y)$ which can soon get complicated as we increase the order. Fortunately there is an easier way that uses rooted trees.

## Rooted Trees

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Rooted_tree" target="_blank">**rooted tree**</a> is a tree where a single node is designated as the **root**. Rooted trees are usually drawn with the root node at the bottom of the tree.

We now define the properties of order and density of a rooted tree

- The **order** of a rooted tree $\tau$, denoted by $r(\tau)$, is the total number of nodes in the tree.
- The **density** of a rooted tree $\tau$, denoted by $\gamma(\tau)$, is a measure related to the number of nodes and the children of the notes in the tree. The density can be calculated using the following:

  - assign a value of 1 to each leaf node in the tree;
  - for all non-leaf nodes assign a value of 1 more than the sum of the values of their child nodes;
  - calculate the product the values of all nodes in the tree which gives $\gamma(\tau)$.

`````{prf:example}
:label: order-density-elementary-weight-example

Determine the order and density of the rooted tree shown below.

**Solution**

There are 7 nodes in this tree so $r(\tau)=7$.

Assigning the weights to the nodes gives

```{figure} /_images/rooted_tree_example_density.svg

So $\gamma(\tau) = 7 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 42$

### Determining derivatives of $f(y)$ using rooted trees

Consider the derivatives of the function $y = f(y)$ using the product and chain rules

$$ \begin{align*}
    y' &= f(y), \\
    y'' &= f'(y)y' \\
    &= (f'f)(y), \\
    y''' &= f''(y)(f(y), f'(y)) + f'(y)f'(y)y' \\
    &= (f''(f,f) + f'f'f)(y) \\
    &\vdots
\end{align*}$$ (derivatives-of-fy)

As you can see this soon becomes complicated, however, English mathematician Robert Merson {cite:t}`merson:1957` noticed that the structure of rooted trees matches that of the derivatives of $f(y)$. Defining a rooted tree notation where $\mathbf{f}$ denotes a node of the tree and the number of children the node has is denoted by a prime, e.g., $\mathbf{f}''$ denotes a node has two children. A child node is written immediately following the parent node and sibling nodes are separated by a comma (using brackets if there are more than one child). 

| $\tau$ | ![](/_images/rooted_tree_f.svg) | ![](/_images/rooted_tree_fdashf.svg) | ![](/_images/rooted_tree_fdashdashff.svg) |  ![](/_images/rooted_tree_fdashfdashf.svg) |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| $r(\tau)$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| $\gamma(\tau)$ | $\mathbf{f}$ | $\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}$ | $\mathbf{f}''(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{f})$ | $\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}$ |

So how do rooted trees relate to the derivatives of $f(y)$? Consider the only rooted tree of order 2 which is $\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}$. If we write $\mathbf{f} = f(y)$ then

$$\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f} = (f'f)(y)$$

which as we saw in equation {eq}`derivatives-of-fy` is equal to $y''$. We can extend this to determine the derivative $y'''$, the two rooted trees of order 3 are $\mathbf{f}''(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{f})$ and $\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}$. Summing these gives

$$ \mathbf{f}''(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{f}) + \mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f}'\mathbf{f} = (f''(f,f) + f'f'f)(y) = y'''$$

So we can determine the $n$-th derivative $y^{(n)}$ where $y'=f(y)$ by summing the rooted tree notation of all the possible $n$-th order rooted trees.

## Order conditions of an ERK method using trees

We can also derive the order conditions of a Runge-Kutta method using rooted trees. To determine the values of $a_{ij}$, $b_i$ and $c_i$ in the Butcher tableau we define a set of **elementary weights**, denoted by $\Phi(\tau)$ which are generated using the following steps:

- associate a label $i$ to the root node and for all non-leaf nodes associate unique labels $j$, $k$, $\ell$ etc;
- write down a sequence of factors for which the first is $b_i$;
- for each edge that does not terminate in a leaf node, write down another factor $a_{pq}$ where $p$ and $q$ are the labels associated with the parent and child node respectively;
- for each leaf node write down a factor $c_p$ where $p$ is the label associated with the parent node;
- sum the product of factors for all possible choices of the labels.

`````{prf:example}
:label: elementary-weights-example

Determine the elementary weight for the rooted tree shown below.

```{figure} /_images/rooted_tree_example.svg

```

**Solution**

Assigning the labels to the non-leaf nodes gives

```{figure} /_images/rooted_tree_example_elementary_weight.svg
:height: 150
```

So the elementary weight is

$$ \begin{align*}
    \Phi(\tau) &= \sum_{i,j,k} b_ia_{ij} a_{ik} c_ic_jc_jc_k
    =  \sum_{i,j,k} b_ia_{ij} a_{ik} c_ic_j^2c_k.
\end{align*} $$

`````

Butcher noticed that comparing the Taylor series expansions for the autonomous ODE $y'=f(y)$ and the general form of a Runge-Kutta method gives the order condition [^1]

[^1]: I've skipped the derivation here, for details see {cite:t}`butcher:2008`.

$$\Phi(\tau) = \dfrac{1}{\gamma(\tau)}.$$(order-condition-relation)

So to derive the order conditions for a $k$-th order $s$-stage Runge-Kutta method we determine the set $T$ of all rooted trees of order up to and include $k$. We then use the condition from equation {eq}`order-condition-relation` for each tree in $T$ to determine the order conditions. In addition to these order conditions there is also a condition placed on the value of $c_i$

$$c_i = \sum_{j=1}^sa_{ij}, $$(row-sum-condition)

i.e., the values of $c_i$ are equal to the sum of the rows of the $A$ matrix, hence this is called the **row sum condition**.

`````{prf:example}
:label: rk2-order-condition-derivation

Use trees to derive the order conditions for a 2-stage second-order explicit Runge-Kutta method.

---

**Solution**

The set of all rooted trees up to and including order 2 is $T = \left\{ \tau_1, \tau_2 \right\} = \left\{ \right.$ ![](../_images/tree_1.svg) $,$![](../_images/tree_2.svg)$\left. \right\}$

The elementary weights and densities of these trees are

$$ \begin{align*}
    \phi(\tau_1) &= \sum_{j = 1}^2 b_i, &
    \gamma(\tau_1) &= 1, \\
    \phi(\tau_2) &= \sum_{j = 1}^2 b_ic_i, &
    \gamma(\tau_2) &= 2.
\end{align*} $$

Using equation {eq}`order-condition-relation` and the row sum condition from equation {eq}`row-sum-condition` we have the following order conditions

$$ \begin{align*}
    b_1 + b_2 &= 1, \\
    b_1c_1 + b_2c_2 &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
    c_1 &= a_{11} + a_{12}, \\
    c_2 &= a_{21} + a_{22}.
\end{align*} $$

Since we are deriving an ERK method, $a_{11} = a_{12} = a_{22} = c_1 = 0$ and the order conditions simplify to

$$ \begin{align*}
    b_1 + b_2 &= 1, \\
    b_2c_2 &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
    c_2 &= a_{21}.
\end{align*} $$

These are the same order conditions for a second-order ERK method derived in the [previous section](rk2-derivation-section).
