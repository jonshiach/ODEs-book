    "The ODEs that we have encountered so far are initial value problems where we know the solution of the ODE at the lower boundary of the $t$ domain. Another type of problem are **Boundary Value Problems (BVP)** which is where the solution at both boundaries of the $t$ domain are known. Here we will be looking at solving two-point boundary value problems based on second-order ODEs.\n",
