    "Like any numerical technique, the QR decomposition methods shown here are prone to computational rounding errors. If $Q$ is perfectly orthogonal then $Q^\\mathsf{T}Q = I$, but if there is bound to be some small error. If we let this error be $E$ then $Q^\\mathsf{T}Q = I + E$. Rearranging gives\n",

    "The both QR decomposition methods shown here use an iterative approach where we orthoganlise the columns of the $A$ matrix in turn based upon the previous iterations. So an error in column $i$ will have a knock on effect on all subsequent columns. To anaylse the methods, the QR decomposition of a random $100 \\times 100$ matrix $A$ was computed using the Gram-Schmidt process and Householder reflections. The Frobenius norm was calculated for the first $n$ columns of $Q$ where $n = 1 \\ldots 100$ giving the loss of orthogonality for those iterations and plotted in below.\n",
