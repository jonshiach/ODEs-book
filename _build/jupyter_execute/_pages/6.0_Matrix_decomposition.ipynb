    "# Matrix Decomposition Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix decomposition**, also known as **matrix factorization**, is the process of breaking down a matrix into simpler components that can be more easily analyzed or manipulated. This involves expressing a matrix as a product of two or more matrices, each with their own properties and applications.\n",

    "For example, consider the matrix $A$ below\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",

    "    4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n",
    "    7 & 8 & 9\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}. $$\n",

    "This can be decomposed into two matrices $L$ and $U$ such that $A = LU$ where\n",
