    "# Adaptive step size control\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementations of the Runge-Kutta methods that we have used previously in this chapter have used a constant value of the step length $h$. Using a fixed step length does not allow the method to take advantage of increasing $h$ where the behaviour of the solution allows. Adaptive step size control is a method that attempts to control the value of $h$ based on accuracy requirements. The accuracy of the approximation to the solution to the ODE is dependent upon three factors: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the order of accuracy of the computational method;\n",
    "- the size of the step length h used to advance the solution;\n",
    "- the behaviour of the solution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Improving the order of accuracy of the method is often not straightforward and can place restrictions on the applicability of the method. Reducing the step length used will improve the accuracy of the approximation but since more steps are required to advance through the domain, this will increase the computational cost. The behaviour of the solution will have an affect on the accuracy of the approximation because computational methods are more accurate where the solution is slowly varying and less accurate where there are rapid variations in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With adaptive step size control we compute two solutions of the ODE over a single step using a step length $h$ using an order $p$ method and an order $p+1$ method and calculate the difference between the two solutions. If this difference is less than a desired accuracy we say that the step has **succeeded** else we say that the step has **failed**. If the step was successful we increase $h$ and move to the next step. If the step had failed we decrease $h$ and repeat the same step. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating the new step length\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step in the method we will be adjusting the value of the step length $h$. If a step has failed we want to reduce the value of $h$ so that the solution using the $p$ order method is more accurate and therefore closer to the $p+1$ order solution. If a step has succeeded this indicates the the step length used could have been larger so we want to increase $h$ but not too much as to result in a failed step in the next step.\n",

    "German mathematician Erwin Fehlberg (1911 - 1990) derived a Runge-Kutta method where different weightings applied to the stage values can result in a method of fourth or fifth-order without having to repeat the calculations of the ODE function. Since Fehlberg's original method, several other Runge-Kutta methods that use the same stage values for producing solutions of different orders have been suggested and these methods are known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Embedded_methods\" target=\"_blank\">**embedded Runge-Kutta methods**</a>.\n",
